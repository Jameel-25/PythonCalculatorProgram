# Calculator using Python and Tkinter

This is a simple calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports the use of parentheses and percentage calculations.

## Features:
- **Basic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide.
- **Parentheses**: Supports grouping of expressions with parentheses.
- **Percentage Calculation**: Calculate percentages directly.
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset the calculator input.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `calculator.py` file.
3. Use the buttons on the calculator interface to input numbers and operations.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Future Enhancements:
- Add error handling for invalid expressions.
- Improve the UI design with additional themes.

This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn more about GUI development in Python or creating basic applications using Tkinter.
